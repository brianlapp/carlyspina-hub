My first session with Carly was warm, inviting and she really helped me understand what to expect before the session started. The way my body responded to the session was unlike anything I experienced before, but my body was finally able to release pent up energy.",

Carly created such a safe and comfortable environment during the session, allowing me to fully relax and trust the process. What truly stood out was her ability to tap into deeper struggles I wasn't even aware ofâ€”issues that turned out to be critical to both my physical and emotional healing.",
