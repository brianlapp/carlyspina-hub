    content: "I had the privilege of receiving a spinal treatment from Carly Spina, and I can't recommend her highly enough. Carly created such a safe and comfortable environment during the session, allowing me to fully relax and trust the process. What truly stood out was her ability to tap into deeper struggles I wasn't even aware ofâ€”issues that turned out to be critical to both my physical and emotional healing. Her intuitive approach and expertise have been transformative for me, and I wholeheartedly encourage anyone seeking true healing to book a treatment with Carly Spina.",
