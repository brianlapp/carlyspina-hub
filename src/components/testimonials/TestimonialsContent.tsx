    content: "My spinal energetic journey started with Carly, as I wasn't new to energy work but this was something I really wanted to try. My first session with Carly was warm, inviting and she really helped me understand what to expect before the session started. The way my body responded to the session was unlike anything I experienced before, but my body was finally able to release pent up energy. I was able to process my emotions and all the while Carly was supporting me. I left feeling lighter, more connected to myself and more emotionally centered. Now I know this is going to be something I wanted to do more frequently. Carly is so kind, loving and provides a safe and supportive environment. If you are looking to work with a true gem and a beautiful soul Carly is your girl.",

Carly created such a safe and comfortable environment during the session, allowing me to fully relax and trust the process. What truly stood out was her ability to tap into deeper struggles I wasn't even aware ofâ€”issues that turned out to be critical to both my physical and emotional healing. Her intuitive approach and expertise have been transformative for me, and I wholeheartedly encourage anyone seeking true healing to book a treatment with Carly Spina.",

I have seen Carly on multiple occasions and my experiences have been nothing but incredible. During my sessions, she made me feel comfortable, calm and at ease. It was incredible to see the headway I developed with my spinal energetic treatments, and the rejuvenating feelings I experienced. It was actually insane to me. I always left feeling happy, confident and more grounded than ever. Carly has taught me how to shift my mindset, she has opened my awareness to the unless possibility my life has to offer. I highly recommend her services, she is amazing, knowledgeable, and an expert in her field.",
